    <p><strong><em>German Plurals</em></strong> is a fun German plural noun quiz game in which the player tries to guess the correct plural form for a set of nouns.<br><br>
      Presently the game is in development:
      <ul>
        <li>Contains 350 nouns adhering to the Goethe-Institut A1 examination, separated into 7 groups of 50.</li>
        <li>Words are pronounced uses speech synthesis.</li>
        <li>Each correct answer earns one point. A false answer resets the score to zero.</li>
        <li>Progress and difficult nouns can be viewed from a list overview.</li>
      </ul>
      Development roadmap:
      <ul>
        <li>Add nouns adhering to Goethe-Institut A2 and B1.</li>
        <li>Release test version on Android and iOS.</li>
        <li>Official release on the App Store and Google Play.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Nouns which have a plural form that is not part of Goethe A1-B1 certifications are denoted "Seldom used", e.g. das Wasser/die Wasser, das Leben/die Leben etc. When questioned, these nouns have a ? button in the top right which displays a popup with relevant information.</li>
        <li>Although Goethe-Institut covers German in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only Hochdeutsch used in Deutschland is considered. Thus die E-Mail instead of das E-Mail, die Fahrkarte instead of das Billet, die Balkone as the plural of der Balkon etc.</li>
        <li><em>German Plurals</em> is a game in which the player tests their knowledge of the plural forms for a set of German nouns, it isn't designed to teach vocabulary. No English (or other language) translations for the German nouns will be included.</li>
      </ul>
