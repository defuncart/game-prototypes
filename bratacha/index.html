            <h1>Bratacha</h1>
            <p><em>Bratacha</em> is a fun flag quiz game as Gaeilge! Presently there are 195 flags oganized into six categories.</p>
            <p>To play the game, first select a level (Whole world, Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) by clicking on the orange button before pressing play. Every correctly answered flag earns a point. At the end of a level, the player's score is displayed.</p>
            <p>Presently the game is in the early stage of development, with the version displayed here a simple proof of concept. Here are some quick points on what I'd like to improve:</p>
            <p><ul>
                  <li>Additional game mode where the player must spell the name of the country.</li>
                  <li>Boosters which show the answer or remove two incorrect flags etc.</li>
                  <li>Another difficulty setting in which similar flags are displayed (i.e. for Ireland, flags of Italy, Mexico and Ivory Coast could be display along with Ireland's flag).</li>
                  <li>Social options: challenge your friends!</li>
                  <li>Bonus Levels: Flags of Ireland.</li>
                  <li>Additional languages: English, German, Polish and Russian.</li>
                  <li>User Interface Update.</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>Thank you for playing <em>Bratacha</em>. Please submit your feedback on the right-hand side of this page, it'll help make the game even better!</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a simulation of a mobile app, thus it takes a little longer to load than the finished game will. Also some flag graphics aren't rendered perfectly in this simulation.</p>
